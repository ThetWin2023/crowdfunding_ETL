## Project 2 - Crowdfunding ETL
## Date: July 26, 2024

This project builds an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas and Pythong Dictionary methods
or regular expressions. After the transformation, CSV output files are created to be used
to create an ERD and a table schema. In final step the CSV files are uploaded into a Postgres database.
